          Meriadoc Brandybuck, known as Merry, is one of Frodo's closest friends and cousins.
          Clever, resourceful, and braver than he knew, Merry insisted on joining the quest
          despite the dangers that lay ahead.

          After the breaking of the Fellowship, Merry was captured by Uruk-hai alongside
          Pippin but escaped into Fangorn Forest, where they roused the Ents to march on
          Isengard. Merry later swore service to King Theoden of Rohan and rode to war
          disguised among the Riders.

          At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Merry played a crucial role in the defeat
          of the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbing the wraith with his Barrow-blade while
          Eowyn delivered the killing blow. This act of courage proved that even the smallest
          person can change the course of history. After the war, Merry became a celebrated
          hero and eventually Master of Buckland.
