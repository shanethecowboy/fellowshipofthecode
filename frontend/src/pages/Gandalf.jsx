          Gandalf is one of the five Istari sent to Middle-earth by the Valar to aid in the
          struggle against Sauron. Known as Gandalf the Grey, he wandered the lands for over
          two thousand years, guiding and counseling the Free Peoples.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Gandalf who first suspected the true nature of Bilbo's ring and who set in
          motion the quest to destroy it. He served as the Fellowship's leader and wisest
          counsel, guiding them through countless perils from Rivendell to the Mines of Moria.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the depths of Moria, Gandalf confronted the Balrog of Morgoth on the Bridge of
          Khazad-dum, sacrificing himself so the Fellowship could escape. He was later sent
          back as Gandalf the White, more powerful than before, to complete his mission and
          lead the Free Peoples to victory.
