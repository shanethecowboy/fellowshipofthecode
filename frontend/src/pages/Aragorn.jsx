          Aragorn, son of Arathorn, is the last chieftain of the Dunedain and the rightful
          heir to the thrones of Arnor and Gondor. Raised in secret in Rivendell by Elrond,
          he spent decades as a Ranger known only as Strider, protecting the lands of the
          North from the shadows.

          A peerless warrior and natural leader, Aragorn joined the Fellowship at Rivendell
          and became its leader after the fall of Gandalf in Moria. His skill with the sword,
          his wisdom in counsel, and his ability to inspire loyalty in others made him
          indispensable to the quest.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the War of the Ring, Aragorn claimed his birthright and was crowned King
          Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom. He married Arwen Evenstar and ushered in a new age
          of peace and prosperity for the realms of Men.
