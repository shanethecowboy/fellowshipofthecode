          Samwise Gamgee, known simply as Sam, was Frodo's loyal gardener and closest friend.
          When Frodo set out on his quest to destroy the One Ring, Sam refused to let him go
          alone, becoming his most steadfast companion throughout the entire journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam's unwavering loyalty and devotion to Frodo proved to be one of the most powerful
          forces in the quest. When Frodo faltered under the weight of the Ring, it was Sam who
          carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom. His simple courage and unshakable love for
          his friend became the cornerstone upon which the quest's success was built.
        </p>

          After the War of the Ring, Sam returned to the Shire, married Rosie Cotton, and became
          Mayor of the Shire seven times. He is often regarded as the true hero of the story — the
          humble gardener whose faithfulness saved Middle-earth.
