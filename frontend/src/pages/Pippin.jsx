          Peregrin Took, known as Pippin, is the youngest member of the Fellowship and one
          of Frodo's dearest friends. Curious, impulsive, and sometimes foolish, Pippin's
          youthful spirit brought both trouble and unexpected hope to the company.

          After the breaking of the Fellowship, Pippin and Merry were captured by Uruk-hai
          but escaped into Fangorn Forest. Pippin later looked into the Palantir of Orthanc,
          inadvertently deceiving Sauron and drawing his attention away from Frodo's true path.

          Taken to Minas Tirith by Gandalf, Pippin swore allegiance to Denethor and became a
          Guard of the Citadel. During the Siege of Gondor, he saved Faramir from his father's
          madness and fought bravely at the Black Gate. Pippin grew from the most unlikely of
          heroes into a true soldier and eventually became the Thain of the Shire.
