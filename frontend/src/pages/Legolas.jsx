          Legolas is the son of Thranduil, the Elvenking of the Woodland Realm in northern
          Mirkwood. He was sent to Rivendell to bring news of Gollum's escape and was chosen
          as a member of the Fellowship to represent the Elves in the quest.

          With his keen Elven senses, extraordinary agility, and deadly accuracy with a bow,
          Legolas was one of the Fellowship's most formidable warriors. His light-footedness
          allowed him to walk on snow without leaving a trace, and his sharp eyes could see
          farther than any mortal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the journey, Legolas formed an unlikely but deep friendship with Gimli
          the Dwarf, overcoming the ancient distrust between their peoples. After the War of
          the Ring, Legolas brought a company of Elves to Ithilien and eventually sailed to
          the Undying Lands with Gimli at his side.
