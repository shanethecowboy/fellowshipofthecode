The user wants me to run the command `uname -a`. This is a simple terminal command that displays system information. I should execute this command for them.

Running `uname -a` to display system information.

[Tool call] run_terminal_cmd
  command: uname -a
  is_background: false

[Tool result] run_terminal_cmd

assistant:

The user rejected the command. They might have wanted to run it themselves, or there was some other reason. I should just acknowledge this.
</think>
The command was skipped. `uname -a` prints system information including the kernel name, hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, and processor type.

If you want me to run it, I can try again.
